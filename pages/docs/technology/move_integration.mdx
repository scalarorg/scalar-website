# Move Integration

![](/docs/introduction/move_integration.png)

Move is an executable bytecode language built with a focus on safety and flexibility, providing several key features that distinguish it from other smart contract languages like Solidity, which is used on Ethereum.

It aims to address issues found in other blockchain programming languages, such as Solidity, while maintaining the fundamental goals of achieving digital scarcity and controlling digital assets.

Move specifically focuses on preventing double-spending and ensuring that digital asset ownership information is properly maintained.

Scalar also supports the Move language used in the Sui/ Aptos blockchain, enabling efficient remote calls via its framework to enhance scalability and performance of Move-based applications

This is achieved by replacing local calls in Sui with remote calls utilizing the Scalaris framework:

- **Move Language Integration**: By leveraging Scalaris for remote calls, the framework enhances the scalability and performance of Move-based applications, allowing them to benefit from the robust, parallel consensus mechanism of Scalaris.
