# What is Scalaris?

<p class="text-lg">Scalaris - An upgraded version of Tendermint.</p>

Scalaris is a novel framework designed to facilitate the rapid development of decentralized applications by leveraging advanced consensus protocols.

Initially built on the cutting-edge research of [Narwhal](https://scalaris-website-dev.vercel.app/docs/overview/narwhal) and [Bullshark](https://scalaris-website-dev.vercel.app/docs/overview/the-bullshark-protocol), Scalaris introduces a leaderless, parallel, high-throughput, scalable, and MEV-mitigation consensus mechanism.

Additionally, we are exploring the integration of a new [DAG-based](https://scalaris-website-dev.vercel.app/docs/overview/dag-based-consensus) and leaderless consensus protocol called [Mysticeti](https://scalaris-website-dev.vercel.app/docs/overview/mysticeti), which promises a throughput of up to 400,000 transactions per second (TPS) and very low latency for consensus commits, around 0.5 seconds.
