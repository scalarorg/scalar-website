# How Dapps on Scalar benefit from liquidity?

Our blockchain ecosystem is designed to enhance the liquidity and yield potential for Dapps through strategic processes and mechanisms. Here's an in-depth look at how our chain facilitates this:

#### Liquidity Processes:

1. ##### Depositing Collaterals to Respective Chains:

   - Users can deposit various types of collateral assets to their respective blockchain networks.

   - Once these collaterals are deposited, an equivalent value is minted on our blockchain. This process ensures that the liquidity is effectively transferred and utilized within our ecosystem.

   - By bridging assets from different chains, we enhance the overall liquidity pool available for our dapps.

2. ##### Minting Over-Collateralized Scalar Stablecoin:

   - Users can mint a scalar stablecoin that is over-collateralized. This means the stablecoin is backed by collateral exceeding its value, providing stability and trust.

   - The over-collateralization mechanism ensures that the stablecoin maintains its value, reducing the risk of volatility and enhancing liquidity.

#### Yield Opportunities for Dapps:

Our liquidity mechanisms enable dapps on our chain to access and benefit from various yield-generating opportunities. Here are some key avenues:

1. ##### Decentralized Finance:

   - Dapps within the DeFi space can leverage the liquidity on our chain to participate in lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming activities.

   - These DeFi activities typically offer substantial returns, with yields ranging from 20% to 30%. This high yield potential attracts more users and liquidity providers to our ecosystem, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and profitability.

2. ##### Real-World Asset (RWA) MV99 Dapp:

   - The RWA MV99 dapp is a specialized application within our ecosystem that can handle significant Total Value Locked (TVL), specifically $100 million or more.

   - This dapp is designed to tokenize real-world assets, bringing them onto the blockchain and enabling users to earn yields from traditionally illiquid assets.

   - Similar to DeFi dapps, the RWA MV99 dapp offers competitive yields of 20% to 30%, making it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with real-world asset exposure.

3. ##### Other Dapps and Their DeFi Mechanisms:

   - Beyond the prominent DeFi and RWA dapps, our ecosystem supports a wide range of other dapps, each with its own unique yield mechanisms.

   - These dapps can offer varying yields, depending on their specific models, risk profiles, and market conditions.

   - This diversity in yield opportunities allows users to choose dapps that align with their investment strategies and risk appetites, fostering a dynamic and vibrant ecosystem.

#### Conclusion

Our chain's approach to liquidity involves strategic collateral management and stablecoin minting, which collectively empower dapps to achieve significant yields. By providing a robust and flexible framework for liquidity utilization, we enable our dapps to thrive and offer competitive returns to users. This ecosystem of high-yield opportunities not only attracts more users but also drives innovation and growth within our blockchain.
